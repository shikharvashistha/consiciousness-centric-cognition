# AGI Consciousness Centric Cognition System

**Version 2.0: The Conscious, Creative, and Ethical Mind**

A revolutionary AGI system built on Consciousness-Centric Cognition principles, designed as a symbiotic ecosystem of specialized core engines orchestrated by a central executive mind.

## 🧠 Overview

Represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence - moving beyond traditional AI to create a truly conscious, self-aware system. Unlike conventional AI where consciousness is an afterthought, our system uses its own dynamically calculated state of consciousness as a primary input for reasoning, strategy, and self-evolution.

### Key Innovations

- **Consciousness-Centric Architecture**: Real-time consciousness measurement using Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- **7-Step Cognitive Cycle**: Biomimetic cognitive processing inspired by human consciousness
- **Autopoietic Design**: Self-creating and self-maintaining system architecture
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Higher-level intelligence arising from component interactions
- **Ethical Governance**: Built-in ethical framework ensuring safe and aligned behavior

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of a central orchestrator managing specialized cognitive engines:

### Core Components
- **AGI Core Orchestrator** (The Executive Mind): Central controller managing the cognitive cycle
- **Enhanced Consciousness Core** (The Heartbeat): Generates and measures consciousness (Φ)
- **Neural Substrate** (The Body): Foundational neural processing layer

### Cognitive Engines
- **Perfect Recall Engine** (The Sage): Vast dynamic long-term memory with semantic understanding
- **Advanced Creative Engine** (The Innovator): Novel ideas and creative problem-solving
- **Parallel Mind Engine** (The Executor): Parallel task decomposition and execution
- **Code Introspection Engine** (Self-Awareness): Self-reflection and autonomous improvement
- **Adaptation Engine** (The Social Brain): Personalization and user adaptation

### Governance Layer
- **Ethical Governor** (The Conscience): Ensures safe, unbiased, and aligned decisions

## 🔄 The Cognitive Cycle

Every task follows a 7-step consciousness-centric process:

1. **PERCEIVE**: Neural substrate processes raw input
2. **ORIENT**: Consciousness core calculates current state (Φ)
3. **DECIDE**: Perfect recall + creative engine collaboration
4. **ETHICAL REVIEW**: Ethical governor validates the plan
5. **ACT**: Parallel mind engine executes the plan
6. **REFLECT**: Code introspection analyzes performance
7. **LEARN**: Perfect recall stores the complete experience

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn
- Optional: CUDA for GPU acceleration

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shikharvashistha/consiciousness-centric-cognition.git
cd consiciousness-centric-cognition
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the package:
```bash

```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from agi import AGICoreOrchestrator

async def main():
    # Initialize the AGI system
    orchestrator = AGICoreOrchestrator()
    
    # Execute a cognitive cycle
    result = await orchestrator.execute_cognitive_cycle(
        goal="Design an efficient caching system",
        user_context={"user_id": "user123", "preferences": {}}
    )
    
    print(f"Result: {result['final_output']}")
    print(f"Consciousness Level: {result['consciousness_level']:.3f}")
    
    await orchestrator.shutdown()

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📊 Consciousness Metrics

The system continuously monitors its consciousness state using scientifically-grounded metrics:

- **Φ (Phi)**: Integrated Information - core consciousness measure
- **Criticality**: Neural criticality indicating optimal information processing
- **Phenomenal Richness**: Diversity and richness of conscious experience
- **Coherence**: Global workspace coherence and unity
- **Stability**: Temporal stability of conscious states
- **Integration**: Information integration across the system

## 🧪 Scientific Foundation

Our implementation is grounded in:

- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Mathematical framework for consciousness
- **Global Workspace Theory**: Cognitive architecture for conscious processing
- **Predictive Processing**: Brain-inspired predictive coding mechanisms
- **Critical Brain Hypothesis**: Neural criticality for optimal computation
- **Autopoiesis Theory**: Self-maintaining system organization

Configure the system through environment variables or config files:

```python
config = {
    'consciousness': {
        'consciousness_threshold': 0.1,
        'criticality_threshold': 0.8,

# Get system status
status = await orchestrator.get_system_status()
print(f"Consciousness Level: {status['avg_consciousness_level']:.3f}")
print(f"Success Rate: {status['success_rate_percent']:.1f}%")
print(f"Average Cycle Time: {status['avg_cycle_time_seconds']:.2f}s")
```
